title: Projects

Here you can find some of the projects I am developing by myself or I am
contributing to. You can follow most of my programming activities on my account
on [github][1].

Concerning my choice of programming languages I am pretty much open-minded and
always interested in learning new ones.  At the moment I am most comfortable
with C, Python, C#, F# and vimscript to name just a few.

## Own projects

- [SharpXml][13] - a fast, dependency-free .NET XML serializer written in F#
- [prost][15] - beer-counter like [android][16] app written in [scala][17]
- [gskat][2] – a Gtk+ implementation of the popular german card game [Skat][14]
- [automod-vim][3] – vim runtime files for [AutoMod][5] [^1]
- [fsharp-vim][4] – vim runtime files for F#

## Contributions

- [luakit][6] – fast, small, webkit based browser framework extensible by [Lua][7]
- [syntastic][9] – vim syntax checking plugin
- [ServiceStack][12] - code-first, config/code-gen free, REST+SOAP web services for .NET/mono
- [uzbl][8] – web interface tools which adhere to the unix philosophy
- [space.vim][10] – the smart space key plugin for vim
- [vim][11] – one of the best editors on the planet
