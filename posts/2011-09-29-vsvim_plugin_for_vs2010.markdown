For all you vim fanatics who want to have vim-like editing experience in your
Visual Studio, there is a great solution waiting for you: [VsVim][1]

VsVim is an open-source vim emulator plugin written by Jared Parsons and it
intents to introduce basic vim functionality into the Visual Studio 2010 editor.
This plugin greatly improves the working experience for all those folks who are
used to the incredible editing power you gain when using vim.

The plugin is mainly programmed in F# and C# which makes it additionally
interesting for me to follow the development. The source code is hosted on
[github][2] and now as of version 1.1 it is licensed under the Apache 2.0
license.
