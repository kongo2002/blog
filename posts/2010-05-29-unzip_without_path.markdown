title: Unzipping without path structure
summary: Ever wanted to unzip files from a zip archive without wanting to
         extract the directory structure?

From time to time I need to unzip just a specific file archived inside a .zip
file. Itâ€™s very unpleasant to unzip the whole archive or the single file with
all the path structure inside the archive being recreated. The solution for
this problem is the argument `-j` to junk all paths.  A typical workflow then
would look like this:

    $ unzip -l archive.zip
    $ unzip -j archive.zip subdir/specific_file.c

To extract the file into a specific directory just append `-d {directory}` to
the command:

    $ unzip -j archive.zip subdir/specific_file.c -d target_dir
