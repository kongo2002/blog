summary: Once in a while it's time for a new blog (engine)
---
It's time for a new blog - and this time I chosed a static content blog engine.
The engine is called rstblog and is written by Armin Ronacher who is known for
great python libraries like [werkzeug][1] and [flask][2].

I just merged all posts of my old wordpress blog into the `rst` [^1] format the
pages of the [rstblog][3] are built of.
