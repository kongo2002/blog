I just want to present my new window manager: [dwm][1]

dwm is surely the smallest and fastest tiling window manager I know. It’s
currently written in under 2000 lines of source code and is only customizable
through editing the `config.h` written in C. That way dwm supports exactly those
features you are really planning to use and I like that very much.

Here’s a small screenshot of my current desktop:
